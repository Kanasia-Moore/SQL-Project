## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hello! Iâ€™m Kanasia Moore. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Iâ€™m currently working toward the Google Data Analytics Certificate, where Iâ€™m building hands-on skills in SQL, Excel, and data visualization tools like Tableau. 
The training has really helped me formalize the technical side of what Iâ€™ve been doing intuitively throughout my careerâ€”analyzing patterns, solving problems, and communicating insights clearly.
That same mindset applies directly to cleaning and interpreting data, spotting trends, and ensuring data quality.


Thanks for visiting my profile!
