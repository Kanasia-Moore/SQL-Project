# SQL-Project-Coming-Soon-
## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hello! Iâ€™m Kanasia Moore. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Iâ€™m currently working toward the Google Data Analytics Certificate, where Iâ€™m building hands-on skills in SQL, Excel, and data visualization tools like Tableau. 
The training has really helped me formalize the technical side of what Iâ€™ve been doing intuitively throughout my careerâ€”analyzing patterns, solving problems, and communicating insights clearly.
In my current role as a TSA Officer, Iâ€™ve developed a sharp attention to detail and the ability to identify anomalies quickly in high-pressure environments. 
That same mindset applies directly to cleaning and interpreting data, spotting trends, and ensuring data quality.
My experience as a Census Enumerator gave me firsthand insight into how raw data is collected, why inconsistencies happen, and how important it is to validate information at the source. 
That context makes me especially thoughtful when preparing or analyzing datasets.
And during my time with City Year, I worked closely with educators to interpret student performance data and translate it into actionable tutoring strategies. 
Thatâ€™s where I learned how to make data meaningful for othersâ€”an essential part of being an analyst.
Across all these roles, Iâ€™ve had to learn quickly, adapt to new systems, and communicate effectively with people from all backgrounds.
What I bring to data analytics is not just technical proficiency, but real-world experience turning data into decisions, patterns into insights, and numbers into stories that drive action.


Thanks for visiting my profile!
